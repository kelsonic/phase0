        This is my first post at Dev Bootcamp! One of the most fascinating aspects 
        to the challenges this week was discovering the various licenses you can 
        attach to GitHub projects. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as you click that list to add a license to your project, the first 
        thing that will undoubtedly pop into your head is 'Whoa, that's a lot of licenses.' 
        The second thing might be 'which license is right for me?'
      </p>
      <p>
        If you haven't already, check out 
        <a href="http://choosealicense.com">Choose A License</a>. 
        They make it very simple to understand the differences between various licenses, 
        particularly the MIT License, Apache License, and the GPL License. Let's look at
        the most widely-used license - The MIT License.

      <p>
        It's a relatively 
        <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">short document</a>,
        but it might not be as fun to read as 
        <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-ridiculous-eula-clauses-agreed/">iTunes' EULA license agreement</a>,
        which forbids you from using iTunes to create nuclear weapons. At any rate, the
        MIT License lets others do anything they want with your code - but they do need to
        provide attribution back to you and they cannot hold you liable for anything they may
        make with your project (including iTunes nuclear weapon software).
