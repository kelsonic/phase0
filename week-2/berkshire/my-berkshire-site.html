    - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
        It was great to finally start coding with HTML. I really liked this challenge as it 
        ensured that we knew all of the different types of HTML tags and formatting.
    - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
        I knew quite a few of them but it was nice to be able to put it to practice. It is 
        interesting how many tags involve styling, such as <center>, <small>, etc. in HTML5, whereas 
        Google will typically penalize your website's SEO if you use styling in your HTML.
    - How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
        Fairly good in that we did not use style="CSS" ever in our HTML but rather just used 
        HTML tags that have styling already, such as the <center> and <small> tags.
    - What seems good and bad about HTML?
        HTML seems great for structuring your webpage, but it is a bit lacking in terms of design customization. 
        It should provide the skeleton for your website, but languages like CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery will be 
        better for UI.
    - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
        Whenver you open a tag, remember to close it immediately even if you have not 
        already written content inside of it yet.
