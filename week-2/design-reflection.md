**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**

*Information Gathering:* Obtain all the necessary information you need in order to build your website. Know who your target market is, what the goal is, what your purpose is, etc.
*Planning:* Create a sitemap for your website and plan on the form your website will take.
*Design:* Create a color scheme and generate a few images of what your website will look like. How will the users interact with your website?
*Development:* Build the website using HTML and CSS while ensuring that it is up to today's web responsiveness standards.
*Testing and Delivery:* Test the website and ensure that all features are both functional and beautiful.
*Maintenance:* Ensure that your website stays up-to-date with the latest gems/plugins/themes/etc.

**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

My website's primary goal is to display my portfolio of websites I have built. My website will need a contact form later on so that potential employers can contact me through it.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

My target audience are employers that are in need of Rails developers. To ensure that they see me as a serious Rails developers, the design must be sleek, professional, and my example websites must be functional with multiple features.

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

The primary action my target audience should take when visiting my website is contact me through the contact form for a job interview.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

User experience is the feeling that a user gets when they are using your website. User experience used to be thought of as "is my website functional and what do I think would make it look coolest?" However, nowadays User Experience has developed into a much more fluid mechanic as usability, design, accessibility, marketing, system performance, ergonomics, HCI, utility, and human factors (psychology, etc.) all play a role in how a user feels while interacting with your website.

Design is how a website is interfaced for a given user that optimizes the user experience. Design can range from the psychological connotations users have from your website's colors to the overall layout flow a user goes through after landing on your website.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**

UX design is vital to users staying on and conducting actions on your website. If a website is designed to optimize user experience, the website will often see increased user interaction and user retention on the website.

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

The challenge was rather simple this time so I found it quite straightforward.
