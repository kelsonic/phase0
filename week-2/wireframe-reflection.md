##Reflection Questions
**What is a wireframe?**

A wireframe is a mockup of the website you are constructing. It should give a good idea what the design of the website will be once it is developed.

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**

A clear and well-defined structure is developed after wireframing a website, which allows you to see exactly the sort of features you will need to implement during development.

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

It is a little tedious, but in general I can appreciate planning before building.

**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

I revised my wireframe a few times until it looked relatively complete. Of course, during development the structure may change.

**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

I was wondering whether all developers need to wireframe their programs before creating them, and in general it seems to be a great idea. Unity video game developers usually create general game documents, which often include a wireframe of what each scene will look like.

**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

I do enjoy planning so that you spend less time in development. I found the mockingbird interface quite nice as well since it inhibited me from getting too much into the details (colors, etc.).
