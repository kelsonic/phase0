#Reflection Questions
**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**

You can open Chrome's DevTools by going to the Chrome menu, click More Tools, then click Developer tools. You can then see both the HTML and CSS from the page you are currently on. You can edit certain elements by merely clicking on them and inputting what you need to customize the page how you envision it. You can also look at the Computed section to see a diagram of a specific element's position, margin, border, padding, height, and width.

**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**

Typcially you should just use the height and the width properties. You can insert either px, em, %, etc. as their values.

**What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?**

Fixed was the easiest to maneuver for us because putting it in a certain position is just a matter of changing top, bottom, right, and left keys. After it is positioned, it just stays there no matter how much you scroll.

Absolute was a bit tricky to maneuver for us because it seemed to overlap divs and, as a result, it was difficult to control.

*Static:* no special positioning, all elements have a default state of static
*Relative:* will position an element relative to its normal position. Any changes to the top, right, bottom, or left will move it away from its normal position.
*Fixed:* elements will be positioned relative to the browser window and will stay in the same place regardless of scrolling.
*Absolute:* elements with absolute positioning is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (in the HTML). 

**What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?**

*Margin* defines space around elements and will clear an area outside of the border. If you use auto as the value for the margin key on a div, it will automatically center the div in your browser.
*Border* is outside of the content and defines the edge of the element. You can edit the border to have different effects, which look sleek when done properly.
*Padding* surrounds content and any changes to it will impact the area in the content as well.

**What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)**

This challenge was very fun! I really enjoyed doing a lot of trial-and-error on the CSS with my pair to mimic the picture. It taught me many different CSS keys and values that I otherwise would not have known.
