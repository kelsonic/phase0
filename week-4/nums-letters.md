**What is an integer? What is a float?**

An integer are whole numbers (that also include negative numbers). Floats are decimal numbers.

**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**

Integer division will round down (ie. 9/2 = 4) and float division will be exact (ie. 9.0/2.0 = 4.5). 
Let's say youâ€™re going to the movies but you only have 9 dollars. Each movie costs 2 
dollars. In this case, you can only see 4 movies since you can't very well see a half 
of a movie. This is integer division and this is why it makes sense.

**Using IRB or submlime, write a program that calculates and outputs the:**

*Hours in a year*

```
p 24 * 365
# => 8760
```

*Minutes in a decade*

```
p 60 * 24 * 365 * 10
# => 5,256,000
```
